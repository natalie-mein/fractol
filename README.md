Fractol is one of three options for the first graphics projects at **Hive** Helsinki, which is a school in the 42 network. This is definitely near the top of 
the list of most fun projects. It was an amazing respite from push swa,, and the fact that you get some lovely output that's not just printouts n the terminal
is a bonus.
### **Description**
From the subject: *"You will use the schoolâ€™s graphical library, the MiniLibX. This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open 
a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
This will be an opportunity for you to become familiar with the MiniLibX library, discover or use the mathematical concept of complex numbers, explore computer graphics
optimization, and practice event handling."*

I used the MLX42 library instead of minilibx.

#### **Mandatory part**

**"Your program must offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set"**

#### **Bonus part**

The bonus part involved more fancy things with the mouse and also an extra fractal. I chose the burning ship fractal:
